Description

In this exercise you will have to implement an algorithm to find the ith smallest element in an array.
To make this more efficient you will have to implement an algorithm that has as worst case run-time complexity O(n).
An explanation of this algorithm can be found here: https://brilliant.org/wiki/median-finding-algorithm/
