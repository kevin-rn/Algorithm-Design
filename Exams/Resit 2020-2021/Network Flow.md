The government is testing what kinds of events can be organised now that the vaccination campaign is in full swing. To that end they have selected n events that they would like to run experiments with. Experimentation requires data collection, and so for every event they want to get at least k measurements.
Fortunately there are plenty of companies interested in helping out! These m
companies all have a number of sensors available to help measure the data. Each sensor can be used for at most 1 event due to hygiene constraints, belongs to a company (as indicated by the array t of length z), and not all sensors are suitable for all events (as indicated by the matrix c of dimension n√óz).

Finally, the government wants to make sure the companies are not faking the data. To this end every event should have at least 2 different companies providing sensors.

The question you should now answer is, given n,m,z,k,t,c is it possible to organise all events?

For this assignment you are advised to use the code made available on WebLab for this assignment specifically.
The Graph, Node, Edge and MaxFlow classes available to you are based on the extended network flow library created in the sessions of the course. You are free to make modifications to these classes, though our reference solutions to this assignment do not modify them in any way.

Functions you may require include:
In the Node class:

    public Node(int id, int d) to construct a new Node object with id id and a demand of d. Please note that a supply is represented by a negative demand.
    public void addEdge(Node to, int lower, int upper) to construct a new edge between this and to with lower bound lower and upper bound upper.

In the Graph class:

    public Graph(List<Node> nodes, Node source, Node sink) to construct a new graph with the nodes nodes, a source source, and a sink sink (use this one if you want to use maximizeFlow.)
    public Graph(List<Node> nodes) to construct a new graph with the nodes nodes. (Use this one if you want hasCirculation() to create the source and sink for you.)
    public boolean hasCirculation() to determine if the graph has a circulation of the value D where D is the sum of the demands in the graph. This method will throw an IllegalArgumentException if the amount of
    supply in the network is not exactly equal to the amount of demand.

In the MaxFlow class:

    public static int maximizeFlow(Graph g) to determine the maximum flow of the graph g. Note that this ignores lower bounds and supplies and demands (see hasCirculation() for using those).
