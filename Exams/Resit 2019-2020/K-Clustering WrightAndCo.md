Misinformation is one of the most dangerous issues that Phoenix faces in his work as a lawyer.
It is paramount in his investigations and cases that he is able to distinguish fake evidence from real evidence.
In order to do so, he has asked you to divide his collected evidence into different groups based on the similarity of the evidence.

The focus for now is on written documents, which can easily be expressed with a dissimilarity score di,j. A higher score means documents are more different.
Given a set of n documents, you are tasked to split them into k>1 groups such that the smallest score between different groups is maximised (meaning that documents that are similar are in the same group).

Since these documents contain a lot of Legalese, the dissimilarity score is not perfect. Phoenix has already done a first round and selected some documents which he assures you must be in the same group as they are really similar.
Even if the dissimilarity score between them is very high, Phoenixâ€™ opinion should overrule this score and they should still always be put in the same group.

Given these prerequisites implement the method legalisingDocuments() which returns the smallest score between any two groups in the optimally created k
groups. Return 0 if it is impossible to make k groups (e.g. because of the first round of information from Phoenix).
